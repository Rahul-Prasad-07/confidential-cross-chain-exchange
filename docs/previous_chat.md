This repository is an **Arcium** project, which is a framework for building confidential computing applications on the Solana blockchain using Anchor. Arcium enables off-chain multi-party computations (MPC) for handling encrypted data, while Solana programs manage the on-chain logic. It's designed for scenarios where data privacy is critical, like financial computations or secure data processing.

### Key Components of the Repo
- **programs/**: Standard Solana programs written in Rust using Anchor. These handle on-chain instructions, account management, and integration with Arcium's confidential computations.
- **encrypted-ixs/**: Confidential computations defined using Arcium's Arcis framework (a Rust-based DSL). These run off-chain in a secure MPC environment (e.g., using backends like Cerberus). The example here is an "add_together" circuit that sums two encrypted values.
- **tests/**: TypeScript tests (using Mocha and Chai) that interact with the deployed Solana program and Arcium network. They initialize computation definitions, queue encrypted computations, and verify results after decryption.
- **migrations/**: Deployment scripts for setting up the program on Solana.
- **app/artifacts/**: Pre-built artifacts like account keypairs, node configurations, circuits (e.g., `add_together.arcis`), and a Docker Compose file (`docker-compose-arx-env.yml`) for running the Arcium localnet.
- **build/**: Build outputs, including compiled circuits and Solana program binaries.
- **Anchor.toml**: Anchor configuration for Solana program deployment and testing.
- **Arcium.toml**: Arcium-specific config for the localnet (e.g., number of nodes, MPC backends like Cerberus).
- **package.json**: Node.js dependencies, including `@arcium-hq/client` for interacting with Arcium networks and `@coral-xyz/anchor` for Solana.

The workflow involves:
1. Defining confidential operations in `encrypted-ixs/` (e.g., encrypting inputs, performing computations off-chain).
2. Using Anchor macros in `programs/` to link on-chain instructions (init, queue, callback) with the off-chain computations.
3. Tests encrypt data, queue computations via the Solana program, wait for MPC finalization, and decrypt/verify results.

### How to Run the Repo
You'll need the **Arcium CLI** (a custom tool, likely installed via npm or from Arcium's docs). It's not in the repo, so install it first (e.g., `npm install -g @arcium-hq/cli` or check their documentation). You'll also need:
- **Solana CLI** (for validator and wallet management).
- **Anchor CLI** (for Solana program builds).
- **Rust** (for compiling programs and encrypted-ixs).
- **Node.js/Yarn** (for tests and dependencies).
- **Docker** (for running the Arcium localnet with MPC nodes).

#### Step 1: Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   - Run `yarn install` (from package.json).
   - Ensure Rust toolchain is set up (there's a `rust-toolchain` file).
   - Install Solana CLI and Anchor if not already.
2. Set up Solana wallet: Ensure `~/.config/solana/id.json` exists (or update Anchor.toml if needed).
3. Install Arcium CLI and any required MPC backends (e.g., Cerberus).

#### Step 2: Build the Project
Run `arcium build`:
- This compiles the `encrypted-ixs/` into Arcis circuits (e.g., `add_together.arcis`).
- Builds the Solana programs in `programs/` using Anchor.
- Outputs go to build (e.g., compiled circuits, IDL files).
- If it fails, check Rust compilation errors or missing dependencies like `arcis-imports`.

#### Step 3: Run Tests
Run `arcium test`:
- This likely automates the full test pipeline:
  - Starts a local Solana validator.
  - Uses Docker Compose (`app/artifacts/docker-compose-arx-env.yml`) to spin up the Arcium localnet (e.g., 2 nodes as per Arcium.toml, with MPC backends).
  - Deploys the Solana program to localnet.
  - Runs the TypeScript tests in `tests/` (via `ts-mocha`, as configured in Anchor.toml).
- The tests:
  - Initialize a computation definition for "add_together".
  - Encrypt inputs (e.g., values 1 and 2) using X25519 and a shared secret with the MPC environment (MXE - Multi-party Execution Environment).
  - Queue the computation on-chain.
  - Wait for off-chain MPC finalization.
  - Decrypt and verify the result (e.g., sum = 3).
- If successful, you'll see test passes and event emissions.

### What to Be Ready for `arcium test`
- **Localnet Startup**: It may take time (up to 60 seconds per Arcium.toml) for the Arcium network to come online. Expect Docker containers for nodes, clusters, and MPC pools.
- **Dependencies**:
  - Docker must be running (for the localnet environment).
  - Solana validator logs may appear; watch for connection issues.
  - The test fetches the MXE public key and interacts with accounts like `mxeAccount`, `mempoolAccount`, etc. (pre-generated in `app/artifacts/`).
- **Potential Issues** (based on your todo list):
  - "admin.rpc does not exist" error: This might occur if the localnet doesn't fully initialize or if RPC endpoints aren't exposed. Check Docker logs, Solana validator status, or Arcium node configs. You may need to wait longer or restart.
  - Network timeouts or retries: The test has built-in retries for fetching keys (up to 10 attempts).
  - Encryption/Decryption: Ensure X25519 keys are generated correctly; failures here indicate MPC backend issues.
- **Hardware/Resources**: MPC computations can be resource-intensive; ensure sufficient CPU/RAM for Docker containers.
- **Debugging**: If tests fail, check Solana logs (`solana logs`), Docker containers (`docker ps`), and test output. The test skips preflight checks for faster execution but may hit runtime errors.

If `arcium test` fails initially, try running `solana-test-validator` manually or check Arcium's docs for localnet troubleshooting. Let me know if you hit specific errors!

Rahul-Prasad-07: okye cool it's working and test passed. now can u explain me what's architecture and system design of this arcium to build and run confidential program ?

and what's commen pattern to build private/confidential program ? explain me full workflow and command pattern to follow?

GitHub Copilot: ### Arcium Architecture and System Design

Arcium is a framework for **confidential computing** on the Solana blockchain, enabling secure multi-party computations (MPC) without revealing sensitive data. It combines Solana's high-throughput on-chain execution with off-chain MPC for privacy-preserving operations. The system is designed for applications like decentralized finance (DeFi), secure auctions, or data analytics where inputs/outputs must remain encrypted.

#### Key Architectural Components
- **On-Chain Layer (Solana Programs)**:
  - Written in Rust using the Anchor framework.
  - Handles public logic: account management, instruction routing, and event emission.
  - Integrates with Arcium via Anchor macros (e.g., `#[encrypted_ix]`) that define hooks for off-chain computations.
  - Accounts store public metadata (e.g., computation definitions, queues), while encrypted data is handled off-chain.

- **Off-Chain Layer (MPC Environment - Arcium Network)**:
  - Runs in a secure, distributed MPC setup (e.g., using backends like Cerberus for threshold cryptography).
  - Nodes (e.g., 2 nodes as in your config) form a cluster for joint computations on encrypted inputs.
  - Uses X25519 elliptic curve for key exchange and AES-GCM for encryption/decryption.
  - Computations are defined as "circuits" (e.g., arithmetic operations) compiled into Arcis (a Rust DSL).
  - Environment includes:
    - **MXE (Multi-party Execution Environment)**: Core MPC runtime for executing circuits.
    - **Mempool**: Queues pending computations.
    - **Clusters and Pools**: Manage node coordination and execution.

- **Integration and Security**:
  - **Encryption Flow**: Inputs are encrypted client-side using shared secrets with the MPC environment. Computations run off-chain without decryption.
  - **Lifecycle**: Init (define computation), Queue (submit encrypted inputs), Execute (MPC off-chain), Finalize (decrypt and callback on-chain).
  - **Trust Model**: Relies on MPC protocols (e.g., secret sharing) to ensure no single node can access plaintext. Solana ensures immutability and ordering.
  - **Localnet Setup**: Uses Docker Compose for a simulated network (e.g., `docker-compose-arx-env.yml`), with Solana validator and Arcium nodes. Production uses a real Arcium network.

- **System Design Principles**:
  - **Modularity**: Separate on-chain (public) and off-chain (private) concerns.
  - **Scalability**: Off-chain MPC offloads heavy computations from Solana.
  - **Privacy**: Zero-knowledge proofs or MPC ensure data confidentiality.
  - **Fault Tolerance**: Distributed nodes handle failures; retries in tests (e.g., up to 10 attempts for key fetching).

This architecture allows building "confidential programs" where sensitive logic runs in MPC, while Solana manages consensus and public state.

### Common Patterns for Building Private/Confidential Programs

Common patterns focus on defining circuits for specific computations (e.g., addition, multiplication, comparisons) and integrating them with Solana programs. Patterns include:
- **Circuit Definition**: Use Arcis DSL in `encrypted-ixs/` to specify operations on encrypted variables (e.g., `let sum = a + b;`).
- **On-Chain Hooks**: Use Anchor macros like `#[init]`, `#[queue]`, `#[callback]` to link to MPC.
- **Client-Side Encryption**: Encrypt inputs using Arcium client libraries (e.g., `@arcium-hq/client`).
- **Event-Driven Flow**: Listen for on-chain events to trigger off-chain actions.
- **Testing Pattern**: Encrypt test inputs, queue, wait for MPC, decrypt and assert results.
- **Error Handling**: Handle timeouts, retries, and MPC failures (e.g., via logs or callbacks).

Avoid patterns that leak data (e.g., no plaintext on-chain) or overload Solana (keep on-chain logic minimal).

### Full Workflow and Command Patterns

The workflow follows a build-test-deploy cycle, using Arcium CLI commands. Assume you're in the build directory (as in your logs).

#### 1. **Setup and Dependencies**
   - Install Arcium CLI: `npm install -g @arcium-hq/cli` (or follow Arcium docs).
   - Install Solana CLI, Anchor, Rust, Node.js/Yarn, Docker.
   - Configure: Update `Anchor.toml` and `Arcium.toml` for your environment (e.g., node count, RPC endpoints).

#### 2. **Define and Build**
   - **Define Circuit**: Edit `encrypted-ixs/add_together.rs` (or create new) with Arcis code.
   - **Build Command**: `arcium build`
     - Compiles circuits to `.arcis` files and Solana programs.
     - Outputs to `artifacts/` (e.g., circuits, IDL).
     - Skip if already built: Use `--skip-build` flag.

#### 3. **Run Localnet**
   - **Start Environment**: `arcium localnet [--skip-build]`
     - Launches Solana validator and Arcium nodes via Docker.
     - Waits for online status (e.g., "Solana localnet is online ‚úîÔ∏è", "Arcium nodes are online ‚úîÔ∏è").
     - Handles genesis accounts and node coordination.
     - Common Issues (from your logs):
       - Timeout: Increase wait time or check Docker resources.
       - `admin.rpc does not exist`: Solana validator issue; restart or check `.anchor/test-ledger/` logs.
       - Panics: Run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` for details; ensure Docker is running.

#### 4. **Test**
   - **Run Tests**: `arcium test [--skip-build]`
     - Cleans artifacts, starts localnet, deploys program, runs TypeScript tests (via `ts-mocha`).
     - Tests: Init computation definition, encrypt inputs, queue MPC, finalize, and verify.
     - Output: Passes/failures, signatures, and container stops.
     - If tests pass (as in your logs), proceed; else debug with logs (e.g., Solana validator logs, Docker `docker logs <container>`).

#### 5. **Deploy and Run in Production**
   - Deploy Solana program: `anchor deploy` (after build).
   - Interact via client: Use `@arcium-hq/client` to encrypt/queue from your app.
   - Monitor: Check Arcium network status and Solana events.

#### Command Patterns Summary
- Build: `arcium build`
- Localnet: `arcium localnet [--skip-build]`
- Test: `arcium test [--skip-build]`
- Debug: Check logs in `.anchor/test-ledger/validator.log`, Docker containers, or run `solana logs` for on-chain issues.

This workflow ensures confidential programs run securely. If you encounter specific errors (e.g., from your logs), provide details for targeted fixes!

Rahul-Prasad-07: okey, now i have attched my current full inter-intra chain (cross-chain) anchor program. we have build that whole same into confidential way/ private / confidential program using arcium.

let's start with relay_offer_clone and write test for that.
note : let's continue building and writing code into current build/src/lib.rs; do not create new one

The test was failing because in the TypeScript code, you were accessing the event field as `relayEvent.cloned_offer`, but Anchor generates event fields in camelCase. The correct field name is `relayEvent.clonedOffer` (note the capital O).

I fixed that in the test file. The decrypt call now uses the correct field name.

Run `arcium test --skip-build` again‚Äîit should pass now, as the confidential computation for "relay_offer_clone" is working correctly (similar to "add_together"), and the decryption should succeed with the proper field access. If it still fails, check the Docker logs or Arcium node status for any MPC execution issues.

Made changes.

Rahul-Prasad-07: explain me what we have achived ? in compare to orignal anchor program and this confidential program ? 
explain me how we have completed this code by code or file by file or funs by fns ; how we have build confidential program and what's workflow and comman pattern ?

write everything in relay_clone_offer.md file in detail and in-depth explanation with proper example and daigram.

GitHub Copilot: Created [](file:///h%3A/Rahul%20Prasad%2001/earn/private/build/relay_clone_offer.md)

The file `relay_clone_offer.md` has been created in your workspace (build directory) with a comprehensive, in-depth explanation. It covers:

- **Achievements**: Detailed comparison between the original public Anchor program and the new confidential Arcium version, highlighting privacy gains, security, and real-world applications.
- **Build Process**: Step-by-step breakdown by file (e.g., lib.rs, lib.rs, build.ts) and function (e.g., init, queue, callback, circuit logic), showing how we integrated Arcium.
- **Workflow & Patterns**: Full command patterns (e.g., `arcium build`, `arcium test`), common development patterns (e.g., encrypt-queue-MPC-finalize-decrypt), best practices, and ASCII diagrams for architecture and flow.
- **Examples**: Code snippets from each component, illustrating the confidential cloning of an offer ID.

The document is structured for clarity, with sections on setup, modifications, and testing. Since the test now passes (as shown in your output), the confidential "relay_offer_clone" is fully functional‚Äîencrypting the offer ID, processing it privately via MPC, and decrypting the cloned result. If you need expansions or diagrams in a different format, let me know!

Made changes.

Rahul-Prasad-07: okey, now i have attched my current full inter-intra chain (cross-chain) anchor program. we have build that whole same into confidential way/ private / confidential program using arcium.

we have completed with relay_offer_clone and written  test for that.

let's work on another one to achive our goal to complete this standalone anchor program to confidential inter-intra chain program

Using "Replace String in File"

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```
Perfect! I've added the `confidential_deposit_native` functionality to your Arcium-based confidential program, following the same pattern as `relay_offer_clone`. Here's what was implemented:

### **What Was Added**

#### **1. Encrypted Circuit (lib.rs)**
- **Circuit**: `confidential_deposit_native` ‚Äì Takes an encrypted deposit amount, processes it confidentially (currently a pass-through; can add validation logic), and returns the processed amount encrypted.
- **Structs**: `DepositInput` (amount: u64), `DepositOutput` (processed_amount: u64).

#### **2. On-Chain Program (lib.rs)**
- **Constant**: `COMP_DEF_OFFSET_CONFIDENTIAL_DEPOSIT_NATIVE`.
- **Init Function**: `init_confidential_deposit_native_comp_def` ‚Äì Initializes the computation definition.
- **Queue Function**: `confidential_deposit_native` ‚Äì Encrypts and queues the deposit amount for MPC processing.
- **Callback Function**: `confidential_deposit_native_callback` ‚Äì Handles MPC output and emits `ConfidentialDepositNativeEvent`.
- **Accounts**: `ConfidentialDepositNative`, `ConfidentialDepositNativeCallback`, `InitConfidentialDepositNativeCompDef`.
- **Event**: `ConfidentialDepositNativeEvent` with `processed_amount` and `nonce`.

#### **3. Test Suite (build.ts)**
- **Test Case**: "Confidential deposit native works!" ‚Äì Initializes comp def, encrypts a deposit amount (e.g., 1000), queues, finalizes, and decrypts/verifies the result.
- **Helper Function**: `initConfidentialDepositNativeCompDef` ‚Äì Sets up the computation definition.

### **Build Status**
- The `arcium build` succeeded and compiled `confidential_deposit_native.arcis`.
- There was a stack overflow warning (likely due to large program size), but it completed. If issues arise, consider optimizing stack usage or splitting the program.

### **Next Steps**
Run `arcium test --skip-build` to verify all three confidential functions (add_together, relay_offer_clone, confidential_deposit_native) pass.

This brings your inter-intra chain program closer to full confidentiality. If there are more original Anchor functions to convert (e.g., from the attached program), let me know which one to tackle next! For example, if there's a cross-chain swap or relay function, we can add it similarly.
